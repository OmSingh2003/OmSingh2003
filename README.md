# 💫 About Me:

🔭 I’m currently working on developing the backend for a banking system using Go (Golang), gRPC, Docker, and PostgreSQL.
<br>
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on DevOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, or infrastructure automation projects.
<br>
🤝 I’m looking for help with advanced Kubernetes concepts like Helm charts or Operators. <br>
🌱 I’m currently learning Kubernetes ($k8s$) and exploring Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Ansible.
<br>
💬 Ask me about Go (Golang), backend development, Docker, CI/CD basics, or my journey into DevOps.
<br>
⚡ Fun fact: I sometimes spend more time optimizing my Dockerfile than the actual application code it's supposed to run.
